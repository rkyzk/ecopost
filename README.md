bugs

* Post couldn't be created through add_story.html.  Integrity error.  Set slugify and worked.
* When posts are made on the admin panel, they have p tags (<p> and </p>) around the content and 
that appears on the page.  --> still need to fix.


log in user id =2, click on my page and got
Reverse for 'post_detail' with arguments '('',)' not found.

search.html
Reverse for 'post_detail' with arguments '('',)' not found.
The word 'search' was recognized as slug.  changed the url from '<slug:slug>/post_detail' to 'detail/<slug:slug>'
and search.html was rendered.
